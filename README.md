# sales-data-analysis
SQL-based sales data analysis project with KPIs, views, and insights


in this project, i built a Business Intelligence system using SQL Server. I started the project with real-world datasets 
representing a bike retail chain, building a normalized schema, importing and transforming data from .csv files, and 
then generating business insights using views, stored procedures, and automated jobs.

## Dataset
The dataset contains sales, orders, customers, products, 
order_items, stores, stocks, brands, categories and staff information.
---[Note: The dataset provided is a sample dataset used to demonstrate the data model and SQL logic.
Full data is not included for confidentiality reasons.]

Key Business Questions:
Sales volume and margin by product category
Revenue by city or region
Orders and revenue handled per staff
Items running low on stock
Ranking products by total sales
demonstrating Revenue, #Orders, AOV per store
